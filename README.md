Sta 523 - Final Project
-----------

Completed final project is due by 5:00 pm on Wednesday, December 11th.

## Guidelines

1. The primary goal of the project is to do something interesting using something related to the course. This is purposefully open ended to give you the opportunity to work on something you are interested in and to produce work that you could potentially show to a prospective employer or use as part of your graduation portfolio.
 
1. The primary way in which you will be evaluate will be based on the evidence of effort in your project and the quality of the write up. What this means is that a "failed" project (e.g. an analysis without a significant result) that is well documented will receive a better grade than a less ambitious "successful" project with a worse write up. 
  
    The expectation is that most projects should be roughly 5-15 pages - including text, code, figures, and other output. This is meant only as a very rough guide to calibrate your work (there are no penalties for the report being too short or too long).

1. We have included a very bare template, `project.qmd` which only includes basic section headings. Feel free to add, adjust, remove these as needed to fit your specific project, they are included only as general guidelines for structuring your write up.

1. You may include all of your code in the qmd document or in one or more R script files - make sure your write up makes it clear how the code is meant to be run and how your results can reproduced. Additional data files and other supplementary materials are also fine as long as they are neatly organized and explicitly discussed in the write up.

1. We have included a basic github action to render your project - if there are issues with this (e.g. data is too large to include, package dependency issues, etc.) then you are welcome to instead include the rendered html in your repository. If you do this, please make sure to include the raw qmd file as well so that we can see the code. In this case you are also welcome to delete or disable the GitHub Action.
